--> This Project is made using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS.
--> It is verified to be running using XAMPP application (Not tested in other servers / environments).
--> Some places' clicks can lead to nowhere or throw error as code is not fully tested.
--> There are several timeouts hardcoded in the code as the onLoad functionality / event from the browser was incosistent,
	hence, in the case that the page throws error, please hard reload the page.
--> Search functionality was shorted to a function which was supposed to be making an API call for search results
	(possibly ElasticSearch), hence, no visible changes on the UI will be noticed, but a 
	console log is made to demonstrate debounce / throttling in the searching mechanism.
